# deamon thread and normal thread in java
> In Java, threads can be classified into two types: daemon threads and normal (or user) threads. Understanding the difference between these two types of threads is essential for effective multi-threaded programming. Here's a detailed explanation:

## Normal (User) Threads
### Characteristics
- Lifespan: A normal thread continues running until its run() method completes. The JVM keeps running as long as there are any normal threads alive.
- Usage: Typically used for the main tasks of an application. These threads perform critical operations that the application relies on.
```
public class UserThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread userThread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("User thread is running");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(5000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            System.out.println("User thread has finished");
        });

        userThread.start();

        System.out.println("Main thread is finishing");
    }
}
```
## Daemon Threads
### Characteristics
- Lifespan: Daemon threads are service providers that typically run in the background and are only needed while there are normal threads running. The JVM exits as soon as all user threads finish, regardless of the state of daemon threads.
- Usage: Used for background tasks such as garbage collection, background monitoring, or housekeeping tasks. These threads should not perform essential application logic because they do not prevent the JVM from exiting.
```
public class DaemonThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
                System.out.println("Daemon thread is running");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);
        daemonThread.start();

        System.out.println("Main thread is finishing");
    }
}
```
### Key Differences
| Feature	| Normal (User) Thread | 	Daemon Thread | 
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| Lifespan	| JVM waits for all user threads to finish before exiting.	| JVM does not wait for daemon threads to finish before exiting.| 
| Purpose	| Used for main application logic.	| Used for background tasks and services.
| Example|  Tasks	Processing user input, performing calculations, etc.| 	Garbage collection, background monitoring, etc.| 
| Default Nature	| Threads are user threads by default.| 	Must be explicitly marked as daemon threads.| 

### Setting a Thread as Daemon
To mark a thread as a daemon thread, you use the setDaemon(true) method before starting the thread:

```
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    // Thread logic here
});
thread.setDaemon(true);  // Mark as daemon thread
thread.start();
```
### Practical Example: Background Monitoring
Let's consider a practical example where a daemon thread is used for background monitoring while the main thread performs some essential tasks:

```
public class DaemonThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread monitorThread = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
                System.out.println("Monitoring in the background...");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        monitorThread.setDaemon(true);
        monitorThread.start();

        Thread userThread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("User thread is running...");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(5000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            System.out.println("User thread has finished.");
        });

        userThread.start();

        System.out.println("Main thread is finishing");
    }
}
```
#### Explanation
- Daemon Thread (monitorThread): Continuously prints a monitoring message. Since it's a daemon thread, the JVM will not wait for it to finish when all user threads are done.
- User Thread (userThread): Simulates some work by sleeping for 5 seconds and then prints a message. The JVM waits for this thread to complete.
- Main Thread: Starts both the monitor and user threads and then prints a finishing message. The JVM will exit after the user thread completes, even if the daemon thread is still running.
#### Summary
- User Threads: Essential for application tasks and keep the JVM running until they complete.
- Daemon Threads: Run in the background for auxiliary tasks and do not prevent the JVM from exiting once all user threads are finished.
> Understanding the difference between daemon and user threads helps in designing applications with appropriate background task management and ensuring that important tasks are completed before the application exits.

##  the daemon thread will continue to execute even after application ends?
> No, daemon threads will not continue to execute after the application ends. In fact, one of the key characteristics of daemon threads is that they are terminated by the JVM as soon as all user (non-daemon) threads have finished execution.

### Here's a clearer explanation:

### Characteristics of Daemon Threads
- Background Execution: Daemon threads run in the background and typically perform tasks such as garbage collection, logging, or monitoring.
- JVM Shutdown Behavior: When all user threads (normal threads) in an application have finished execution, the JVM will shut down, and any remaining daemon threads will be abruptly terminated.
- Non-Blocking: Daemon threads do not prevent the JVM from exiting. They are considered non-essential for the application to complete its execution.
#### Example to Illustrate Behavior
##### Let's modify the example to make it more clear:

```
public class DaemonThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
                System.out.println("Daemon thread is running");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);  // Mark as daemon thread
        daemonThread.start();

        Thread userThread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("User thread is running");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(5000);  // Simulate some work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            System.out.println("User thread has finished");
        });

        userThread.start();

        System.out.println("Main thread is finishing");
    }
}
```
#### Explanation of Execution:
- Daemon Thread:

The daemonThread prints "Daemon thread is running" every second.
It's set as a daemon thread using setDaemon(true).
- User Thread:

The userThread prints "User thread is running", sleeps for 5 seconds, and then prints "User thread has finished".
It's a normal user thread.
- Main Thread:

The main thread prints "Main thread is finishing" and then completes.
- JVM Behavior:
- While User Thread is Running:

Both the daemon thread and the user thread will run concurrently.
The daemon thread will continue to print "Daemon thread is running" every second.
- After User Thread Completes:

Once the user thread completes (after 5 seconds), the JVM will check if there are any remaining user threads.
Since there are no user threads left, the JVM will initiate a shutdown.
As part of the shutdown process, the JVM will terminate all remaining daemon threads.
#### Observations:
The output will show "Daemon thread is running" printed a few times, depending on how long the user thread takes to finish.
After "User thread has finished" is printed, the JVM will terminate, and the daemon thread will be abruptly stopped.
You will not see the "Daemon thread is running" message after the user thread has finished because the JVM will have terminated the daemon thread.
#### Conclusion:
Daemon threads will not continue to execute after the application ends. They will be terminated by the JVM once all user threads have completed their execution. This makes daemon threads suitable for background tasks that do not need to block the termination of the application.

### so main will not stop before finishing main thread, right?
> Correct, the main thread (the primary thread of execution in a Java application) will not stop before it completes its execution. The JVM will keep running as long as any user (normal) thread, including the main thread, is still running. Here is a more detailed explanation with examples to illustrate this:

### Key Points
#### Main Thread Execution:

The main thread starts the execution of the program.
The main thread will run to completion unless explicitly stopped (e.g., using System.exit()).
#### User Threads:

Any user threads (including the main thread) will keep the JVM running until they have all completed.
#### Daemon Threads:

Daemon threads run in the background and do not prevent the JVM from exiting.
If the main thread and all user threads finish, the JVM will terminate all daemon threads and shut down.
```
public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create and start a daemon thread
        Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
                System.out.println("Daemon thread is running");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);  // Mark as daemon thread
        daemonThread.start();

        // Create and start a user thread
        Thread userThread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("User thread is running");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(5000);  // Simulate some work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            System.out.println("User thread has finished");
        });

        userThread.start();

        // Main thread logic
        System.out.println("Main thread is finishing");
    }
}
```
### Explanation of the Example
#### Daemon Thread:

The daemonThread prints "Daemon thread is running" every second.
It's set as a daemon thread using setDaemon(true).
Since it’s a daemon thread, it will be terminated when all user threads, including the main thread, finish.
#### User Thread:

The userThread prints "User thread is running", sleeps for 5 seconds, and then prints "User thread has finished".
It's a normal user thread, so it keeps the JVM running until it completes.
#### Main Thread:

The main thread prints "Main thread is finishing" and then completes.
The main thread will complete almost immediately after starting the other threads because it has no blocking operations.
### JVM Behavior:
- Daemon Thread Execution:
The daemon thread will start and keep printing its message every second.
- User Thread Execution:
The user thread will start and run for 5 seconds.
- Main Thread Execution:
The main thread will quickly print its message and then complete.
### Observations:
You will see "Main thread is finishing" printed almost immediately.
"User thread is running" will be printed next, and after 5 seconds, "User thread has finished" will be printed.
During these 5 seconds, you will also see "Daemon thread is running" printed multiple times.
Once the user thread finishes, the JVM will exit, and the daemon thread will be terminated.
Important Points:
Main Thread: The main thread will always run to completion unless explicitly interrupted or terminated.
JVM Termination: The JVM will wait for the main thread and all user threads to finish before terminating. At this point, it will also terminate any running daemon threads.
### Summary
- The main thread will not stop before it finishes its execution.
- The JVM will keep running as long as any user threads (including the main thread) are still running.
- Daemon threads will be terminated when all user threads have completed.
